## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Some of things I learned along the way were flexbox from CSS better control of the div. I also learned how to use a var for colors I thought that was pretty cool. I learned how to make the website responsive thats always good to learn. 


```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>

/* i used inner style with html. the file path to the image could be tricky*/

<div class="pricing">
      <article>
      <img src="./images/icon-music.svg" alt="">
        <div>
          <h4 style="font-weight: 800;">Annual Plan</h4> 
          <p>$59.99/year</p>
        </div>
      </article>
      <button class="btn btn-change">Change</button>
</div>


```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {

/*this uses a var to assign a color*/
color: var(--desaturated-blue);

/*the hover animations are cool */
.btn-primary:hover,
.btn-change:hover{
	opacity: 0.8;
	text-decoration: none;
}

 }
```

### Continued development

I'm looking forward to do more challenges from frontend mentor. It was a lot of fun and I got to test my skills out. I will try to tackle the next challenge soon I'm going to do more of the beginner friendly. I want to get better with JavaScript thats something I want to incorporate.
Thank you,
